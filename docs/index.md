RNA-Seq with Kallisto and Sleuth
================================

Goal
----

**Analyze RNA-Seq data for differential expression**. is a quick,
highly-efficient software for quantifying transcript abundances in an
RNA-Seq experiment. Even on a typical laptop, Kallisto can quantify 30
million reads in less than 3 minutes. Integrated into CyVerse, you can
take advantage of CyVerse data management tools to process your reads,
do the Kallisto quantification, and analyze your reads with the Kallisto
companion software in an R-Studio environment.

Sample data

**About the Sample Dataset** In this tutorial, we are using publicly
available data from the SRA. This tutorial will start with cleaned and
processed reads. The SRA experiment used data from bioproject . The
abstract from that project is reprinted here:

'To survey transcriptome changes by the mutations of a DNA demethylase
ROS1 responding to a phytohormone abscisic acid, we performed the
Next-gen sequencing (NGS) associated RNA-seq analysis. Two ROS1 knockout
lines (ros1-3, ros1-4; Penterman et al. 2007 \[PMID: 17409185\]) with
the wild-type Col line (wt) were subjected. Overall design: Three
samples (ros1-3, ros1-4 and wt), biological triplicates, ABA or mock
treatment, using Illumina HiSeq 2500 system' .

<div class="admonition tip">

**Working with your own data**

If you have your own FASTQ files upload them to CyVerse using
instructions in the CyVerse (e.g. iCommands/Cyberduck).
